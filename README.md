Hi! I'm Álex, though in the online world, I go by Urhon—a nickname inspired by a book I started writing as a teenager (though it never got an ending). I studied computer engineering with a specialization in internet technologies, but my true passion lies in teaching. I'm currently an IT and mathematics teacher. The thought of working for a big corporation and watching someone else rake in the profits doesn't quite appeal to me. Teaching, on the other hand, is my calling. Helping others feel more prepared for the future and a bit happier fills me with joy.

When I'm not delving into the intricacies of code, you'll likely find me lost in the mountains. I love disappearing into the woods, camping, and facing nature's challenges. Ironically, despite my love for IT, I think I'd be happier without the internet. Funny, right?

My approach to solving IT challenges revolves around understanding the basics and building knowledge from there. I might be a bit slow in solving these challenges (thanks to my ADHD), but that's because I like to thoroughly understand all the concepts. Sometimes, I even create scenarios to test these ideas.

Welcome to my blog, where IT meets the great outdoors, and learning is a journey, not a race.
